Neural Sequence labeling model implemented using PyTorch
======
State-of-the-art sequence labeling models mostly utilize the CRF structure with input word features. LSTM (or bidirectional LSTM) is a popular deep learning based feature extractor in sequence labeling task. Besides, features within word are also useful to represent word, which can be captured by character LSTM or character CNN structure.

This repository provide a PyTorch based framework with flexiable choices of input features and output structures, inculde BiLSTM-CRF with character LSTM features ([Lample .etc, NAACL16](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N/N16/N16-1030.pdf)) and character CNN features ([Ma .etc, ACL16](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1101.pdf)). You can build your own structure in different input/output combination with minimum code work.

Welcome to star this repository!

Requirement:
======
	Python: 2.7   
	PyTorch: 0.3.0

Features
========
* State-of-the-art sequence labeling model with the combination of different input features(word embedding, char LSTM, char CNN ) and output structures (CRF, softmax). i.e. (BILSTM-CRF, BiLSTM) x (character LSTM, character CNN, None).
* Batch training/decoding supported, with fast running speed. Most model cost less than 1 minitus for each epoch, finish the whole training process within 2 hours (with the help of GPU).
* Character feature can be selected within LSTM, CNN or None (through `data.char_features="CNN"/"LSTM"` or `data.HP_use_char = False` in file `main.py`).
* Output structure can be choosed in CRF or softmax (by using `from model.bilstmcrf import BiLSTM_CRF as SeqModel` or `from model.bilstm import BiLSTM as SeqModel` in file `main.py`).
* Bidirectional LSTM-CRF with character features give the best result on Named Entity Recognition (NER) task. 

Performance
=========
Results on CONLL 2003 English NER task are better or comparable with SOTA results with same structures.    
In default, `LSTM` means bidirectional lstm structure.
